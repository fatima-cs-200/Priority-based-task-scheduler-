| **Feature Built**                                          | **Problem / Limitation Found**                                                  | **Improvement Idea**                                                           | **Who Will Fix** | **Expected Impact**                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Add New Task (Queue)**                                | Queue accepts tasks even with invalid priority (negative / very large)          | Add **input validation** & **auto-normalize priority** (e.g., 1–10 range only) | Fatima           | Prevents program crashes & keeps priority system clean    |
| **2. Get Highest Priority Task (Max-Heap Priority Queue)** | Heap breaks when tasks have *same priority* → unpredictable order               | Add secondary sorting key: **timestamp** or **task ID**                        | Fatima           | More fair and predictable task execution                  |
| **3. Search Task by ID (HashMap)**                         | HashMap doesn’t update when task is deleted or popped from heap                 | Sync all operations: remove from HashMap when removing from heap/queue         | Fatima           | Avoids “ghost tasks” & inconsistent lookups               |
| **4. Display All Tasks (Traversal)**                       | Display shows raw priority numbers without explanation                          | Add “priority label” (e.g., High/Medium/Low)                                   | Fatima           | Better user understanding, more readable UI               |
| **5. Delete Task Operation**                               | Deleting from heap or hash map is inconsistent; queue still keeps stale entries | Implement **two-way syncing** between all DS: Queue, Heap, HashMap             | Fatima           | Eliminates bugs; keeps data structures perfectly aligned  |
| **6. Error Handling**                                      | Program crashes if user enters letters instead of numbers                       | Add robust **try/catch** and input cleaning                                    | Fatima           | More stable program; no unexpected termination            |
| **7. Code Structure**                                      | All functions in one file → messy, hard to maintain                             | Split into classes: `Task`, `TaskManager`, `Heap`, `Queue`, `HashMap`          | Fatima           | Cleaner code, easier debugging, future expansion possible |
| **8. Performance Issues**                                  | Searching tasks in queue is slow (O(n))                                         | Always use HashMap for lookups; queue only for arrival order                   | Fatima           | Faster performance even with 1000+ tasks                  |
| **9. User Interface (CLI)**                                | No guidance for invalid options                                                 | Add help messages & menu re-prompt                                             | Fatima           | Better UX; prevents wrong input flow                      |
| **10. Future Expansion**                                   | No scheduling algorithms yet (FCFS, SJF, RR)                                    | Add optional scheduling modes                                                  | Fatima           | Big upgrade; makes project look professional              |
